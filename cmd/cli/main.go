	Bonsai is the frontend web framework we use to build the vast majority of web apps at Jane Street. Here is some example code:

	### 
	type phase1_value
	type phase1_witness
	type phase2_value

	val only_callable_in_phase1 : phase1_witness @ local -> phase1_value

	val run_phase1 : (phase1_witness @ local -> 'a) -> 'a
	val run_phase2 : phase1_value -> phase2_value
	###

	This leverages the compilerâ€™s escape analysis for local values, with the phase1_witness serving as proof we are in the correct phase.
